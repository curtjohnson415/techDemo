# I chose the Employment Information Reports dataset provided by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs as I am interested in looking at how affirmative action polices affect outcomes for workers. Using this data, I can gauge the results of companies that are required to abide by affirmative action policies, as they are bound by their contracted labor with the federal government. I will be comparing this dataset to another one which I have yet to find about outcomes for workers in private companies. I hypothesize, as a result of brief literature reviews I have conducted, that the demographic that will be shown to have benefitted the most from these policies will we white women.
